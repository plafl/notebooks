    "We have $N$ hard drives we want to use for backup. Each one has capacity $C_i$ for $i=1 \\ldots N$. For each file to be backed up we want to store $R$ replicas and we want the hard drives to be more or less used according to their capacity in such a way that, after some time being used, all of them are, for example, at 60% of their capacity, instead of one being fully filled and others empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's call $C$ the total capacity of the hard drives:\n",
    "$$C=\\sum_{i=1}^N C_i$$\n",

    "Let's call also $c_i$ the fraction of the total capacity that hard drive $i$ provides:\n",
    "$$c_i = \\frac{C_i}{C}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "One simple algorithm if we want to just make one replica is to randomly select one hard drive each time we want to store a replica, with probability proportional to the hard drive capacity. Let's call $S=i$ the event that consists of selecting hard drive $i$. Then:\n",

    "$$ P(S=i) = c_i $$\n",

    "In the following sections we discuss the case where $R > 1$. We want to continue filling the hard drives proportionally to their capacity, but with the constraint of not storing two replicas of the same file in the same hard drive.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Two replicas (R=2)\n",
    "\n",
    "Before discussing the general case it's better to analyse this particular case. Now, each time a new file is to be replicated, we must select two hard drives. Let's call the action of selecting the first $S_1$ and the second $S_2$. We want to calculate the probabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(S_1=i, S_2=j) $$\n",

    "Let's call $S=i$ the event of selecting hard drive $i$ as the first or the second hard drive. Since we cannot select the same hard drive for the two replicas the events are disjoint and we have that:\n",
